### What is an emulator?
- Imitates a device
- Allows app testing
- Allows multiplatform testing eg. Apple to test on Windows and vice-versa
- 7 commercial well known open-source Emulators 
- Bluestacks, Appetize.io

### Mobile App Testing (AVD)
- Allows to define features about multiple existing devices
  
### Mobile CPU architecture ARM, ARM64 and x86?
As of now, there are three main CPU architectures used in most smartphones --- ARM, ARM64 and x86. CPU types include:

- ARM: ARMv7 or "Armeabi" (most common; optimized for battery use)
- ARM64: AArch64 or arm64 (Support 64bits and it's becoming the new standard)
- x86: x86 or x86abi (Least commonly used, better than ARM, not battery friendly)


Overall, **ARM** better embodies a mobile-first mentality, with **simple instruction sets**, **efficiency** and **low power consumption** as its major priorities. The fact that it requires fewer transistors and frees up that hardware space more than makes up for the use of RAM in a mobile device.


### Operating System Images
- Allows to test app on older and newer OS's
- Higher api level means newer OS. E.g: API 33 is the newer Tiramisu OS 

### Common libraries and packages
Don't reinvent the wheel: most of common tasks already have a library for it.  These open source libraries are hosted on an external server and are downloaded by the build system, Gradle, when you are building a project.
### Types of libraries
- Image loading
  - Fresco: image loading library that provides smooth scrolling, also helps avoiding high RAM conspumption
- Videos
  - ExoPlayer: easy customizable, built by Google. It's an alternative to Android's Media Player API.
- Networking
  - Retrofit: make internet calls within the application
